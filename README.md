# Animal_Shelter_Dashboard
 
 ## This dashboard visualizes animal shelter data and provides insightful monitoring metrics.   
 ## Two datasets, representing intakes and outcomes, were merged and are the source for the plots.  
 ## Each plot contains a dropdown menu containing more information on the visualization.  
 ## I created this dashboard as a personal project.  
 ## I love pets and wanted to create something using my newly learned data science skills.  
 ## Any questions about the dashboard can be answered by contacting kyzerf@uark.edu. Enjoy!
